<h1> C++ One File Game Challenge </h1>
<hr>
<p>This "game" was created using C++ (obviously) and is written in one file! I used the SFML Library to create a render window and draw sprites to it.</p>
<hr>
<p>The game uses a 32x32 tile system, and the ground tiles are generated along with the actual displayed tiles, to ensure that after an entity is touched, the tile will not change
  to a random tile type of the ground. This was originally created as a school project, and became more of a challenge, as I could use math and solve logical problems. </p>
    <p>As far as any functionality goes, it's a "game", but it isn't fun, and the enemies do not respawn. There is a hit system, which is extremely intuitive and was a lot easier to make than I expected.
  If you'd like to look at it and try it out, let me know. Right now there is only the cpp file (main.cpp), and none of the dependencies were uploaded. </p>
